Soundex Algorithm : The Soundex algorithm encodes a string into a code.
The Algorithm steps are:
1. Convert the first letter of the name to uppercase.
2. Replace subsequent letters with digits based on a lookup table.
3. Remove duplicates of the same digit.
4. Append zeros because the code is of length 4.

Public Interface : void generateSoundex(const char *name, char *soundex);
Generates a Soundex code for the given input string name and stores the result in soundex.

Test Specifications:

Unit Testing:
Code Coverage: All branches of the "generateSoundex" function are tested, including the conversion of characters, 
handling of non-alphabetic characters, and padding of the final code.

Components:
Function: generateSoundex
Supporting Functions: getSoundexCode, isUpperCaseLetter, isSuoundxCode, addToSoundex, initializeSoundex, 
padSoundex, isSoundexComplete, isIndexWithinBounds, canContinueProcessing, processSoundex

Verification:
Expected Output: Verify that the output matches the expected Soundex code for each test case.
Test Coverage: Ensure that all code branches, including those for non-alphabetic characters and digit handling, are Covered.


Test Cases:
1. Test Case Name: ReplacesConsonantsWithAppropriateDigits
Scenario: Single character padding
Steps:
Given "AB" as input, then "A100" is expected.
Requirement Specifications:
The function should convert a single letter to a digit (based on the lookup table) and pad with zeros until the length reaches 4.

2. Test Case Name: testcase1
Scenario: Numbers and Letters
Steps:
Given "ABXY" as input, then "A120" is expected.
Requirement Specifications:
The function should ignore non-alphabetic characters (numbers) and encode the alphabetic characters according to the Soundex mapping.

3. Test Case Name: testcase2
Scenario: Repeated Letters
Steps:
Given "CDLM" as input, then "C345" is expected.
Requirement Specifications:
The function should encode distinct consonants and ignore repeated letters, while ignoring non-alphabetic characters.

4. Test Case Name: testcase3
Scenario: Digit-Only Input
Steps:
Given "PJAY" as input, then "P200" is expected.
Requirement Specifications:
The function should keep the first letter or number as is and return a code consisting of zeros if the input contains only digits.

5. Test Case Name: testcase4
Scenario: Lowercase Conversion
Steps:
Given "BPDL" as input, then "B134" is expected.
Requirement Specifications:
The function should convert all lowercase letters to uppercase. Only the first 4 letters should be considered; the rest should be ignored.

6. Test Case Name: testcase5
Scenario: Special Characters and Digits
Steps:
Given "U" as input, then "U000" is expected.
Requirement Specifications:
The function should replace special characters and digits with '0', encoding only alphabetic characters if they are within the length of 4

7. Test Case Name: testcase6
Scenario: upper and lower Case with repitative as Input
Steps:
Given "VM" as input, then "V500" is expected.
Requirement Specifications:
The function should process all type of letters, encode them correctly, and handle duplicate letters by ignoring subsequent occurrences.

8. Test Case Name: testcase7
Scenario: Repitative Letters
Steps:
Given "AEI" as input, then "A000" is expected.
Requirement Specifications:
The function should encode the first character and ignore subsequent duplicates, padding the code as zero.
